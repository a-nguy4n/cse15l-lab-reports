# Lab Report #5: Debugging and Reflection 
This lab report will be tackling a debugging scenario and then reflecting on the Spring Quarter lab experience! 

## Debugging Scenario

## Reflection 

  In the second half of this quarter, I found the VIM tool to be very interesting as each key on the keyboard corresponds
  to a command that can help you efficiently edit your code. I learned that VIM commands can customizable, 
  which allows me to adapt my method of coding in an effective, structured style. For example the commands to delete like
  < dw >, delete a word, and < dd >, delete a whole line, can be customized. 
  
  This customization can be seen here:
  
  **Command < dw >**
  
  < d6w > 
  - This command means delete 6 words. 
  
  **Command < dd >**
  < 4dd >
  - This command means delete 4 lines.
