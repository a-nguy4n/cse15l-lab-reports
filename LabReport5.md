# Lab Report #5: Debugging and Reflection 
This lab report will be tackling a debugging scenario and then reflecting on the Spring Quarter lab experience!

### Student's Post Breakdown 

From the student's post it can be found that: 

**The symptom** is a type mismatch where the code cannot convert from double[] to int[].

**The bug** appears to be from line 30, the return statement.

**Failure - Inducing Inputs** are from the JUnit tests: testReversed and testReversed2. Moreover, 
the commands < javac ArrayTests.java > and < javac ArrayExamples.java > .

### TA Response:
  
  It appears to me that you are right on your bug coming from a type mismatch by trying to 
  convert a double array into a type integer array. In your method header, you declared that you 
  will return an array of type int[]. However, in line 22 of your method, you have created a double array.
  To fix this bug, try making this array into an integer type instead of a double. Afterwards, compile your code
  and run tests to see if this bug has now been fixed!

 ### Student's Debugging 
  
  The student's debugging of the suggested line 22 can be seen here:

  **The outputs after debugging can be seen here:**
  
  **Compile Success -** After fixing the method line and running the command < javac ArrayTests.java > , 
  it is successful as no error message is outputted.

  **JUnit Tests Passes -** The student's test cases have now passed without the type error message 
  appearing in the test cases: testReversed and testReversed2.

  **Bug Description**
  - The bug was a type mismatch where the method required an int[] type to be returned on line 30. However, the method
  body created a double[]. This means that the method then does not return an int[] because of the double[]
  that was created in line 22. Thus, there is a conversion error between the types as the method is specific to returning
  an int[].

## Reflection 

  In the second half of this quarter, I found the VIM tool to be very interesting as each key on the keyboard corresponds
  to a command that can help you efficiently edit your code. I learned that VIM commands can customizable, 
  which allows me to adapt my method of coding in an effective, structured style. For example the commands to delete like
  < dw >, delete a word, and < dd >, delete a whole line, can be customized. 
  
  This customization can be seen here:
  
  **Command < dw >**
  
  < d6w > 
  - This command means delete 6 words. 
  
  **Command < dd >**
  
  < 4dd >
  - This command means delete 4 lines.
