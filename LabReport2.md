# Lab Report #2: Servers and Bugs 
This lab report will discuss the web server, String Server, and address bugs within a code. 



## Web Server - String Server 




## Bugs: from Array Methods
The Array Methods are intended to reverse a list, however, because of bugs in the code it 
does not output the expected results. 

**The Bug**  The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)


There is a bug specifically in the "reverseInPlace" method that incorrectly changes the input array to be in reversed order: 
The bug would correctly reverse the first half of the list, but in the second half retains the same values rather than the reversed values.

```
public class ArrayExamples {

  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
 }
 ```


**Input & Symptom** - The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
- Test 1 
  - Input: Failure Inducing 

  ```
  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace2(){
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{5,4,3,2,1}, input1);
  }
  ```

-Test 2 Symptom 
  -Input: Non-Failure Inducing 
  
  ```
    @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace3(){
    int[] input1 = {3,3,3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,3,3}, input1);
  }
  ```

**Failure Inducing Input**
- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)



**Non-Failure Inducing Input**
- An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)



**Addressing the Bug**
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.
