# Lab Report #2: Servers and Bugs 
This lab report will discuss the web server, String Server, and address bugs within a code. 



## Web Server - String Server 
A server is made where it will print out the string inputted into the path.

## Bugs: from Array Methods
The Array Methods are intended to reverse a list, however, because of bugs in the code it 
does not output the expected results. <br>


**The Bug**  
There is a bug specifically in the "reverseInPlace" method that incorrectly changes the input array to be in reversed order: 
The bug would correctly reverse the first half of the list, but in the second half retains the same values rather than the reversed values.

```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
 ```
<br>


**Input & Symptom** - The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
- Test 1 
  - Failure Inducing Input

  ```
  @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace2(){
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{5,4,3,2,1}, input1);
  }
  ```
      
      
  - Symptom 
     ![Image](ReverseOut1.png)

 The input {1,2,3,4,5} is meant to be reversed into {5,4,3,2,1}. However, this test fails because of bug only reverses the first half of the list successfully. But starting at index 3, the element values stay the same as it is expected to be 2. In actuality, the result is 4. 

<br>


- Test 2 
  - Non-Failure Inducing Input
  
  ```
    @Test 
  public void testReverseInPlace3(){
    int[] input1 = {3,3,3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,3,3}, input1);
  }
  ```
  - Symptom
  
    ![Image](ReverseOut2.png) 

 The input {3,3,3} is reversed into {3,3,3}. This test passes as opposed to Test 1 because the values stay the same. As such, the order of reversing does  not necessarily matter at which index and element. Thus, this test successfully passes. 

<br>


**Addressing the Bug**
In order to fix the bug and get the desired outcome, the code is then altered to: 

```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      int temp = arr[i]; 
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp; 
```

- Essentially rather than loop the entire list, it is better to loop through half of it. In doing so, you don't swap the elements twice.  

- Then create a temporary variable. This is meant to store arr[i] values. 
- Setting arr[i] to arr[arr.length - i - 1] reverses the first half of the list. 
- Setting arr[arr.length - i - 1] to temp reverses the second half or "swaps". 

By altering the code to iterating to half the list length and setting a temporary variable, the bug is then resolved since it 
will no longer set the second half of the list to the non-reversed elements. Rather, the list elements at their indices will now be "swapped". 
For instance, list {1,2,3,4,5} will now correctly swap/reverse to {5,4,3,2,1}.
