# Lab Report #2: Servers and Bugs 
This lab report will discuss the web server, String Server, and address bugs within a code. 



## Web Server - String Server 




## Bugs: from Array Methods
- The Array Methods are intended to reverse a list, however, because of bugs in the code it 
does not output the expected results. 


**The Bug**
- The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)



**Symptom**
- The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)




**Failure Inducing Input**
- A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)



**Non-Failure Inducing Input**
- An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)



**Addressing the Bug**
Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue.
