# Lab Report #4: Vim Command Line Task 
This lab report will be a step-by-step process of forking a repository, cloning the repository, 
and using VIM to edit and save the file. 

## Step 1: Setup - Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
  
  1) Go into your GitHub account and into the repository.
  <br>
   
   
  2) Go to the repository's settings

  <br>
  
  
  3) Scroll all the way down and click on the button 'Delete this repository'. 
     This will delete any exiting forks of the repository.

  <br>
  
  
  4) Additionally, log into the @ieng6 account. Then use the command **rm -r lab7/** to remove the directory
     from the account in order to follow the next steps. When this is completed, log out of the account.

## Step 2: Setup - Fork the repository

  1) Follow this [link](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7) to fork Lab 7's repository.

<br>


## Step 3: Start the timer!

  1) Begin a timer to determine your baseline in logging in, cloning, and editing the code. 
<br>


## Step 4: Log into ieng6

  1) Use the command: **ssh cs15lsp23__@ieng6.ucsd.edu** to remote login. 
  ```
  ssh cs15lsp23il@ieng6.ucsd.edu
  ```
  
  - With ssh you can remote login to your account in order to begin the cloning process of the repository.
    

<br>


## Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
  1) Use the command: **git clone < ssh link >** to clone the repository from your GitHub account into your ieng6 account
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:a-nguy4n/lab7.git
  ```
  2) Use the command **ls** to check if the repository has been cloned into the account. The directory name **lab7** should be listed. 
    >![Image](Lab7Check.png)
   
    - If the name of directory is shown in the output, cloning is a success!


  3) Then, use the command **cd** to get into the repository and access its files. 
  ```
  cd lab7/
  ```

  4) Once the directory has changed into that repository, use command **ls** to see the files inside. 
     By doing this, you can gain access to the files in order to follow the next steps to test and edit.

## Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
  1) To run a test use the command: **bash test.sh** . The command will run tests on the 'ListExamples.java' file.
  - Input
    ```
    bash test.sh
    ```
  - Output 
    ```
    JUnit version 4.13.2
    ..E
    Time: 0.534
    There was 1 failure:
    1) testMerge2(ListExamplesTests)
    org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException: test timed out after 500 milliseconds
        at ListExamples.merge(ListExamples.java:44)
        at ListExamplesTests.testMerge2(ListExamplesTests.java:19)

    FAILURES!!!
    Tests run: 2,  Failures: 1
    ```

<br>


## Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test

<br>


## Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed


## Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
